"""The backend abstraction.

A backend adapts one environment manager (uv, pixi, ...) to the kernel. The
launcher is backend-agnostic: it finds or creates a manifest, ensures
``ipykernel`` is declared, then execs into the kernel inside the managed
environment. Each backend supplies the manager-specific command strings.

To add a new backend, implement this protocol and expose it from a thin package
whose ``__main__`` calls :func:`ipykernel_env_core.launch_kernel` /
:func:`ipykernel_env_core.install_main` with an instance.
